# WoWFeatureExtractor
Extraction of user interaction features from World of Warcraft

this is a project for the practical course "multimedia information extraction"
at Fernuiversit√§t in Hagen, summer 2023

Record user interactions with the integrated WoW Addon,
then convert the recorded data into an .xml file that is 
compatible with the GMAF framework (https://github.com/stefanwagenpfeil/gmaf)
